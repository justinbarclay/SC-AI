Outline:

Need to scan map for chokepoints, and note them. Store in information manager.
Need to adjust Build Order (I think?) to build more buildings, and place them at the nearest chokepoint to our base.
Then, we figure out how to make the AI place the buidlings at the choke point on our side, so that we effectively wall our base.
Also, if under attack, get our SCV's to help repair our buildings at the chokepoint.
